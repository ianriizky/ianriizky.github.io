      <>
        The goal was to turn Notion into a fully-functional, SEO-optimized
        blogging platform with zero setup. I built a SaaS solution using Next.js
        and Supabase that converts Notion content into live blog pages in
        seconds. This solution enabled creators to launch personal blogs
        effortlessly, saving both cost and time.
