        <p>
          Hi! I&apos;m Septianata, a fullstack web developer with over 7 years
          of experience building SaaS platforms, scalable APIs, and modern web
          applications. I specialize in combining reliable backend logic with
          fast, SEO-optimized frontends â€” from idea to production.
        </p>

        <p>ðŸ”§ Tech stack I use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: Next.js, React, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS</li>
          <li>Backend: Laravel, NestJS, Express, ElysiaJS, Hono</li>
          <li>Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Supabase</li>
          <li>DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Vercel, Heroku, Fly.io</li>
          <li>Other: Notion API, CMS integration, JWT/Auth, REST, GraphQL</li>
        </ul>

        <p>ðŸš€ I help you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build and launch SaaS MVPs from scratch</li>
          <li>Develop fast and scalable REST/GraphQL APIs</li>
          <li>Create custom dashboards, admin panels & CMS</li>
          <li>Implement auth systems, role-based access, data modeling</li>
          <li>Optimize performance (Core Web Vitals, SSR, CI/CD)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I write clean, modular code, document well, and care deeply about
          developer experience and product stability. Whether you&apos;re a
          startup founder or scaling a digital product â€” I can help you ship
          faster and smarter.
        </p>

        <p>
          ðŸ’¬ The latest SaaS platform I built reduced setup time by over 50%,
          allowing the team to focus on growth instead of infrastructure â€” using
          clean, scalable code that&apos;s ready to grow with their user base.
        </p>

        <p>Let&apos;s build your next SaaS together! ðŸš€</p>
